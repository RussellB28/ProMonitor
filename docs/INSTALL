             INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------

Before running pBot, you MUST run the configuration utility to check that you have all the required modules.
To do this use:

./configure

If all required CPAN modules are working and exist, you are ready to start using ProMonitor.
Before you do, you will need to edit the following files:

* configs/bot.conf
* configs/bl/dnsbl.conf
* configs/bl/nicks.conf
* configs/bl/idents.conf

Once you have edited all the required files, it is highly recommended you generate some new SSL certificates
as the private and public key are both accessible by the public and can be used on your irc server. To do this
use SSH and change to the configs/ssl directory. You will need to execute the following commands in order:

* openssl genrsa -out promonitor.key 1024
* openssl req -new -key promonitor.key -out promonitor.req
* openssl req -x509 -days 30 -key promonitor.key -in promonitor.req -out promonitor.pem

Once you have edited and generated all the required files, you are then ready to run ProMonitor!
To do this use the recommended command:

'nohup perl run.pl > bot.log &'
